# §2.2.1.3.1 Properly anchor all horizontal-loading ASRS rack structures to prevent them from falling over and



causing nearby racks to fall over (i.e., a “domino” effect). Take into consideration the effects of rack loads,the additional load created by the collection of fire protection water by the stored commodity and its container(see Section 2.1.2.5), the weight of water-filled, in-rack sprinkler piping (if provided), any seismic conditions(see FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet [i.e., Data Sheet] 1-2, Earthquakes ) and the type of

flooring to which the rack structure will be anchored to. Retain a qualified structural engineer to perform theanalysis and design of any anchoring of the storage racks.

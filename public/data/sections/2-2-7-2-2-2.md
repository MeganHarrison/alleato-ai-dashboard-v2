3. While the in-rack sprinkler designs given in Table 40 are based on flow, the corresponding design

pressure for the chosen in-rack sprinkler cannot be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar). When the design pressurewill be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar), use a minimum pressure of 7 psi (0.5 bar) for design purposes,regardless of the in-rack sprinkler’s K-factor value.

flue spaces, install the in-rack sprinklers vertically using the design guidelines indicated in Section 2.2.7.2.2.1.However, include all of the in-rack sprinklers installed between the vertical barriers in the in-rack sprinklerdesign.

For example, if a wet, in-rack sprinkler system is being used to protect open-top, unexpanded plastic

containers being stored within a mini-load ASRS which is to be protected with in-rack sprinklers per Figure37, and the number of in-rack sprinklers between the vertical barriers is 9, then the design for the in-racksprinkler system would be per Table 40 and would be based on 9 IRAS @ 100 gpm (380 L/min) instead of6 IRAS @ 100 gpm (380 L/min).Fig. 37.

# ยง2.2.1.1.2 What differentiates horizontal-loading ASRS storage arrangements from traditional pallet load



storage rack arrangements include:

1. Rack uprights in a mini-load type ASRS that are typically only about 2 ft (0.6 m) apart horizontally as

opposed to about 8 ft (2.4 m),

2. Tiers that are only about 12 to 18 in. (300 to 450 mm) high as opposed to about 5 ft (1.5 m),3. Product handling that consists of 18 in. x 24 in. (450 mm x 600 mm) trays or open-top containers as

opposed to 4 f tx4f t (1.2 m x 1.2 m) pallets,

4. Material handling support in mini-load type ASRS storage arrangements which is accomplished by angle

irons as opposed to horizontal supports.

While bullet points 1 through 4 create a unique storage arrangement for horizontal-loading ASRS, it is the

presence of the angle irons within the mini-load ASRS rack structure that has a major impact on the protectionrequirements for them. This is because the angle irons divert most of the sprinkler discharge out to the faceof the rack, thus limiting the amount of sprinkler discharge that can be distributed into the transverse fluespaces of the storage rack.

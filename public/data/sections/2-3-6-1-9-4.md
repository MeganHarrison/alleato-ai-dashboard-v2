# §2.3.6.1.9.4 When permitted by Section 2.3.6.1.8.3, install visible imaging cameras over the entire storage



grid, using dedicated feeds to the remote location designated for monitor nozzle operation, as follows:

A. Install cameras, capable of panning and tilting, that have a minimum spatial resolution of 15 pixels/ft

(45 pixels/m), measured at the farthest position from the camera along the top surface of the storage array.

B. Locate the cameras vertically as high as possible over the storage grid while also avoiding obstruction

to the camera’s view. Position the cameras horizontally as close as possible to the halfway markin-between the locations of the fixed-in-place monitor nozzles. Maintain a minimum horizontal distanceof 10 ft (3.0 m) from any camera to the nearest fixed-in-place monitor nozzle.

C. Install the cameras so that every column of the storage array can be viewed by a minimum of two

cameras.

D. When possible, incorporate data into the camera view that can communicate to the remote location

operator the specific location of the storage grid the camera is viewing.

E. Arrange the recording equipment so that review of the video is possible to help identify where flames

have been visually observed.

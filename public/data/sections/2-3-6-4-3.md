# ยง2.3.6.4.3 Hose Demand Design Guidelines



A. Include a minimum flow of 500 gpm (1,900 L/min) for the hose demand design.B. When both fixed-in-place monitor nozzles are provided in accordance with Section 2.3.6.1.8 and small

hose connection stations are provided in accordance with Section 2.3.6.1.6, account for the 500 gpm (1,900L/min) hose demand design as follows:

1. Include a flow of 200 gpm (760 L/min) from each of the two most remote monitor nozzles (400 gpm

[1,520 L/min] total) as part of the hose demand design, and

2. Include a flow of 50 gpm (190 L/min) from each of the two most remote small hose connection stations

C. When only fixed-in-place monitor nozzles are provided in accordance with Section 2.3.6.1.8, account for

a flow of 200 gpm (760 L/min) from each of the two most remote monitor nozzles (400 gpm [1,520 L/min]total) as part of the hose demand design. Account for the remaining 100 gpm (380 L/min) hose demand byadding it to the overall ceiling sprinkler system demand at the point of its connection to the water supply.

D. When only small hose connection stations are provided in accordance with Section 2.3.6.1.6, account for

a flow of 50 gpm (190 L/min) from each of the two most remote small hose connection stations. Accountfor the remaining 400 gpm (1,520 L/min) hose stream allowance by adding it to the overall ceiling sprinklersystem demand at the point of its connection to the water supply.

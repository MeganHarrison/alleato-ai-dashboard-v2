# ยง2.3.7.7.3 Pre-Incident Plan



1. A piping system dedicated solely for the small hose connection stations, or

2. Piping that connects the stations to a sprinkler system that is different than the one protecting the ASRS

storage area.

D. The installation of small hose connection stations can be avoided at the documented discretion of the

local authority having jurisdiction.

For TL-ASRS storage arrangements that use non-solid-walled containers, establish a pre-incident plan with

the local fire service that takes into consideration how the local fire service will gain access to any point ofthe ASRS storage grid for final extinguishment purposes. Items to consider, at a minimum, are:

A. Access to the storage grid itself (i.e., removal of any separating walls or fences),B. A plan to remove storage containers along with a place to put them, andC. A means of preventing robots from falling from the grid into the storage area.

See Section 2.1.5 for additional guidance on pre-incident planning.

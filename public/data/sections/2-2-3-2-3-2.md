not limit the storage height above the top in-rack sprinkler level, the ceiling sprinkler system can be designedusing the applicable protection table (i.e., Tables 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, depending on the commodity hazardbeing protected). The ceiling height to be used in the protection table is obtained by taking the verticaldistance between the top in-rack sprinkler level and the ceiling.

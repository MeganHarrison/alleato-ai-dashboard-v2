# §2.2.4.2.2.2 Storage Racks Requiring Vertical Barriers



When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are required due to the lack of acceptable transverse

flue spaces, install the in-rack sprinklers vertically using the design guidelines indicated in Section 2.2.4.2.2.1.However, include all of the in-rack sprinklers installed between the vertical barriers in the in-rack sprinklerdesign.

For example, if a wet, in-rack sprinkler system is being used to protect open-top, unexpanded plastic

containers being stored within a shuttle ASRS which is to be protected with in-rack sprinklers per Figure 17,and the number of in-rack sprinklers between the vertical barriers is nine, then the design for the in-racksprinkler system would be per Table 23 and would be based on 9 IRAS @ 100 gpm (380 L/min) instead of6 IRAS @ 100 gpm (380 L/min).Fig. 17.

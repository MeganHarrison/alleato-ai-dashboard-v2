# ยง2.3.6.1.7 Vertical Barriers2.3.6.1.7.1 To assist with firefighting efforts, consider the installation of vertical barriers throughout the ASRS



storage area. When vertical barriers are to be provided throughout the storage area, install them as follows:

A. Use minimum 20-gauge (0.9 mm) sheet metal for the vertical barriersB. Install the barriers from floor level to the top of the storage arrayC. Attach the vertical barriers to each of the storage columns with a minimum of 3 tech screws per column

(near the top, middle, and bottom)

D. Provide a minimum 3 in. (75 mm) overlap, sealed with fire-rated silicone, of the barriers with the floor

and all sheet metal joints

E. Where the vertical barriers are required at corners, bend the sheet metal around the corner to avoid

any seams at these locations

# §2.2.3.2.2.1 Storage Racks Not Requiring Vertical Barriers



1. When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are not required due to transverse flue spaces

being provided, use the following tables to determine the allowable in-rack sprinkler vertical locations,as well as the corresponding recommended in-rack sprinkler design:

A. Table 15: Wet, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a shuttle ASRS, or

B. Table 16: Dry, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a shuttle ASRS

2. Any green highlighted protection cell within Table 15 represents (1) an arrangement where the in-rack

sprinkler system and the ceiling sprinkler system do not need to be hydraulically balanced at their pointof connection, and (2) a potential design where the top in-rack sprinkler tier level can represent a virtualfloor. The ceiling sprinkler system can be designed using the applicable protection table (i.e., Tables4 through 13, depending on the commodity hazard being protected) with a ceiling height obtained bytaking the vertical distance between the top level of in-rack sprinklers and the actual ceiling above.However, for this option to be applicable, the aisle width must be acceptable for a ceiling-only protectionoption as indicated in Section 2.2.3.1.1.

3. While the in-rack sprinkler designs given in Tables 15 and 16 are based on flow, the corresponding

design pressure for the chosen in-rack sprinkler cannot be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar). When the designpressure will be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar), use a minimum pressure of 7 psi (0.5 bar) for designpurposes, regardless of the in-rack sprinkler’s K-factor value.

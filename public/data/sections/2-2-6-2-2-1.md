# §2.2.6.2.2.1 Storage Racks Not Requiring Vertical Barriers1. When Section 2.2.1.4 indicates that vertical barriers are not required due to transverse flue spaces being



provided, use the following tables to determine the allowable in-rack sprinkler vertical locations as wellas the corresponding recommended in-rack sprinkler design:

A. Table 32: Wet, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a mini-load type ASRS, orB. Table 33: Dry, In-Rack sprinkler system protecting a mini-load type ASRS

2. The maximum storage height above the top in-rack sprinkler level is 10 ft (3.0 m).3. While the in-rack sprinkler designs given in Tables 32 and 33 are based on flow, the corresponding design

pressure for the chosen in-rack sprinkler cannot be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar). When the design pressurewill be less than 7 psi (0.5 bar), use a minimum pressure of 7 psi (0.5 bar) for design purposes, regardlessof the in-rack sprinkler’s K-factor value.

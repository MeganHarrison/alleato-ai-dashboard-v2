See Data Sheet5-48 to determine the installation requirements needed for the detection system to achieve a sprinkler systemdesign classification of wet pipe. Design the single-interlocked preaction system using the dry-pipe sprinklersystem designs in Table 43 when the detection installation is not in compliance with the recommendationsprovided in Data Sheet 5-48 for a wet-pipe sprinkler system design.

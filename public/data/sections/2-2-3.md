Combustible Containers, or (2) Products that Do Not Collect Water that are Stored on Trays

The protection guidelines in Section 2.2.3 apply only to storage that is not considered open-top, whether

stored directly on the support rails of the ASRS or on trays. Such products will be subsequently referred toin Section 2.2.3 as “storage on trays”. If the product or containers allow for water collection, use the protectionguidelines provided in Section 2.2.4.

Section 2.2.3 is organized as follows:•Section 2.2.3.1 determines if a ceiling-only protection option is available and, if it is, the recommended

ceiling-only protection designs.

•Section 2.2.3.2 determines the recommended designs when both ceiling and in-rack sprinklers are installed.

This section is further broken down into the following subsections:- Section 2.2.3.2.1 provides acceptable horizontal in-rack sprinkler arrangements.- Section 2.2.3.2.2 provides both the acceptable vertical in-rack sprinkler arrangements as well as the

corresponding in-rack sprinkler system design.

- Section 2.2.3.2.3 provides the acceptable ceiling sprinkler system design with the chosen in-rack sprinkler

system arrangement.

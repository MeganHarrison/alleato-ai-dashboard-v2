# §2.2.1.1.1 Section 2.2 provides protection guidelines for horizontal-loading automatic storage and retrieval



systems (ASRS). This type of storage arrangement is further subdivided into two specific types of ASRSstorage: (1) a shuttle ASRS, and (2) a mini-load type ASRS. A shuttle ASRS has horizontal supports that donot interfere with the flow of sprinkler discharge into the transverse flue space. See Figure 2 for an exampleof this storage arrangement. The shuttle system shown in Figure 2 uses metal slats for the support of thetrays or containers; other shuttle systems use mesh type or similar shelving to support the trays or containers.A mini-load type ASRS uses angle irons, or similar guides, for the support of trays or containers within therack structure. See Figure 3 for an example of this storage arrangement.

Follow the DoD from CLAUDE.md:
1) Call `ts-doctor` → wait for success proof.
2) Call `lint-stylist` → wait for success proof.
3) Call `test-runner` → wait for green summary.
4) Call `build-gatekeeper` → wait for successful build output.
5) (Optional) Call `link-auditor` if routing changed.
6) (Optional) Call `rag-evaluator` if AI flows changed.
Only after all are green, post a final “All gates passed ✅” checklist with the pasted outputs.

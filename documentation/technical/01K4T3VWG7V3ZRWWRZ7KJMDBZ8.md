Jay. There you go. I'm muted. That helps if I got my microphone on. 
**1:**
He's muted, Jay. 
**2:**
You might as well turn it off for a second. 
**0:**
Jesse, can you hear me now? 
**2:**
Yeah, but I don't know if you want to hear that. Jack up all the window openings with the ES guy and covered all the weeps. 
**0:**
What? 
**2:**
Yep, just found that out. If this guy said Jack told him to bring it all the way up and he was supposed to keep it down. 
**0:**
But these are a storefront window. You're telling they have weeps in them? 
**2:**
Apparently. I haven't looked yet. I just found this all out. 
**0:**
So it's the glass guy that came to tell you this? 
**1:**
Yeah, alleatogroup fist over the weeps in the glass. 
**0:**
But again, aren't these storefront punched openings? 
**1:**
The bottom of those have the weeps in the metal down there. If they bring the eephus up over that or caulk it, it fucks them all up. 
**0:**
Part of this is either Nick didn't press them for it, but he never got a shot growing from these guys. Like, we went into it blind, just guaranteeing a rough opening. No details for how to put them in or finish him off. So, I mean, I know Jack doesn't know what a weep is. Even so, he's not going to be any help to figure something like that out in the field. But, like, they didn't have the right documentation. So I would tell Diamond Glass, get us some shop drawings so we know, like, where are these weeps at? You know? Jesus. Well, what else is that? Like, what are we waiting on to get this lady the photo of that medal? I can't believe they're still working on that. It's 1:30. 
**2:**
Yeah, he's supposed to get me that and the pavement photos anytime now. 
**0:**
I mean, she didn't really care about the pavement. It was just chewed up. 
**2:**
Yeah, he doesn't want to. He wants to get a picture where he can capture it without them in it. They said they should be wrapping up right about now. 
**0:**
Yeah, but if he's got the metal one, send it. Like, the metal being done. That's. That's what their concern was. Am I just unclear when I send them things? I don't get it. 
**2:**
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out all this, too. 
**0:**
I mean, as far as I thought, like, the second we get one thing knocked off the list, we send them an email just so they know we're, like, on it. And it also bugs them to remind them to look at this with their supervisor. 
**2:**
You know, I just Confirmed with them on the call that we have one more picture to go to him of that back area. He's sending that update any minute too. It should look a lot better than what we've gotten so far. 
**0:**
Yeah. And we picked one of the standard caulks. We got them doing the caulking. 
**2:**
Yeah, they're just going mortar color. I don't know why they were chasing custom colors in the first place. 
**0:**
Yeah. Holy. We got two different types of block on that thing now. The new block. 
**2:**
Yeah, Jack just messaged you. Sending it out now. 
**0:**
Okay, I got a picture from September 10, and DOC leveler is no longer there. Or is that an old picture that they just posted? 
**2:**
Just pull them up. 
**0:**
I mean, we don't get something going with the building department now, we're gonna lose today. 
**2:**
Yeah, I don't get what the deal is with that. That loading dock picture. That must be an old one. Andrew did say his pictures were kind of mixed up when he was putting them in here. And those are the one. These are pictures he put in there? 
**0:**
Yeah. These are all from yesterday when they were doing the downspouts. Then you got new ones. Because today I know the caulking was figured out. 
**2:**
Yeah, because yesterday you got the pictures of the bollard pipes laying in the parking lot, and those have been set since Friday. 
**0:**
Don't tell me they're putting white on the front. White where? Caulking white. 
**2:**
What do you. What are you talking about? 
**0:**
Look at the go to job plan and look at the photos. And then they got like, baccarat and a caulk joint that's white. 
**2:**
Oh, with those pictures he's got up. 
**0:**
There, I mean, what color are they using? 
**2:**
That's it. That's mortar color. 
**0:**
I know, but look right above it. The. They're going into the existing. It's like bronze. 
**2:**
Find that picture. 
**0:**
It's the. The first picture. If you zoom in at the top. Oh, that one white. 
**2:**
Yeah, that one joint right there. 
**0:**
Oh. So they got the bronze. A bead of bronze, and above it be of white. So they're doing the bronze correct on the outside. 
**2:**
What bronze are you talking about? I'm looking at the first picture, and I don't see what you. What you mean. 
**0:**
So zoom in on the top. The very top of the photo. 
**2:**
Yeah, it comes off. 
**0:**
Hold on. This is that photo. So job plan. 
**2:**
Oh, that's okay. 
**0:**
That's not the first one. 
**2:**
That's not the first one on my list. 
**0:**
Okay, but see this? It's a bronze darkish color. Oh, like, there's this one. I hope they're not caulking it with white is all I'm saying. 
**2:**
No, what I talked to him about was they had mortar gray. I think it's just the picture that makes it look like it might be white. But I can. It looks great to me in this picture. 
**0:**
It looks like it might look at my screen. Yes. So they use this one? 
**2:**
No, I think they use the one above it. 
**0:**
Yeah. But look like this is the existing caulk. They run up with this. We're going to have this white line that goes to here and then it goes back to this color. 
**2:**
But we have all gray mortar joints in that new block right there. 
**0:**
But it doesn't matter. That stuff's all going to weather out at some point. I don't know what, because the white shit is on there. 
**2:**
So what I got with the. This morning was that you were involved in the decision with Nick on what color to use, and that's what they were using. So that's where I left it. 
**0:**
Jack, couple things. First, do we have a picture of the aluminum wrap over that dense glass? The funk. Okay, two. What color caulk are they using? Are they matching the caulk that was already there? It's a dark, bronzest color. It looks as close to caulk as possible. So that's the dark one that's below. There's two in job planner, there's two caulk joints. There's one really white and then there's one below it that's very. It's dark. We're going with the dark one. Correct. The first one I see has got a backer rod hanging out of the wall and two beads above it. One bead is a dark color and one beads. A white color matches what, though. Look at that. When it gets to the top, it's going to meet the caulk that's already there and that's brown or bronze. They haven't done it yet. Okay. Make sure, like, we're matching the existing caulk. We're going to run into it everywhere on that outside. It's going to look like dog. If we got. I'm not matching something similar. Like if someone says, I want a similar shirt and pants. If they put white shirt on and a black pants, is that similar? Or if they put a dark gray shirt on and black pants, does that make sense? Yeah, it's gonna stand like a sore thumb. Need to match as close as possible to that existing caulk on the inside. White. Every wall is white. But on the outside, we want to. What? That's the closest color to that existing caulk. Then that's the color. But, like, what are we mimicking? Are we mimicking that brick? Did they mimic it on the other. Is the rest of that entire store look like that? I know, but that's effervescence or something that needs to be scrubbed off of there. They picked a mortar that matched the existing mortar. So at some point, our new mortar should look just like that old mortar or very close to it. Same with the block. I mean, it's just. That's. That's not a permanent thing. That's effervescence. Okay, thank you. Bye. Who. Okay. You guys still there? Yeah. Okay. He's gonna call them. I. They're not doing it today, but he's calling to get the right thing. But, like, everywhere around here, we're going to be butting ours caulk joint into the stuff that's already there. Mm. So if we put white in, it's gonna look like this is gonna look bad. Okay. All right. So didn't have an agenda here, but so first, I guess, Jim, you. You're having AJ fill in all the job information? 
**1:**
That's correct. AJ's doing all the existing ones and all the upcoming ones. 
**0:**
Okay, perfect. And I told him, don't worry about putting the people in there. That's what we'll do. But just get all the projects on, because, I mean, he'll be leaving here. 
**1:**
He said he's gonna get it here shortly. 
**0:**
Is he okay? 
**1:**
Yeah. But as far as doing the proposal for that warehouse, and then he's doing this. 
**0:**
Yeah. Okay. And I don't know, maybe talk to you guys privately, but, like this last weekend, I met this guy. They bought a condo. Did I tell you this, Jim or Jesse? 
**1:**
You told me about it. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**2:**
Yeah, me, too. 
**0:**
And so UPS guy. Yeah, the UPS guy. And so you think about us, like, for someone to be able to handle that and not be crazy, he's got a pretty good system. And, like, that one thing he said about making sure everyone gives us bad news, you know, the favorite news we want to hear, because, number one, we know what if there is a problem? And typically, the first thing he says, I'd ask him is like, okay, what are you doing about it? What are you doing to fix it? And he said it built in them. Like, they wouldn't come. You know, they would report the bad news, but they'd all so be working immediately on a way to fix it, because that's the first question they're going to get asked. And, you know, just with everything we see at Bloomington like this. Caulking is a perfect example. This thing. This has been a problem for four months or three months or however long we've had that block done. But Nick either isn't aware of it or he's not saying it's a problem because, like, we're picking colors today, and that's all. Somehow we gotta, like. And you guys are both, like, from a lot bigger jobs and a lot more things going on. This seems like child's play almost for the things we're dealing with. 
**1:**
But it's a loose end that needs to be dealt with. I mean, I get why you're dealing with it. It's the loose end. Let's make you look good. I agree, and, well, I care. 
**2:**
I went through this with them and I don't think any of them knew that caulk was required here. Because we looked at the contracts and they all thought that the mason had it. Because the mason's contract says all control and expansion joints, not nothing about sealing joints. So if you're a mason and you look at that, that's the usual. You're not caulking anything. But the. Our guys thought it was caulking. I don't think they have the experience to know these things. 
**0:**
Yes, but if I'm Jack and I'm walking around my job site every day and I see light, and every time it rains, I'm getting water in the building somehow, I would imagine, like, just the fact that's what we got to somehow instill in our guys is you don't just walk by that every day and think it's going to fix itself or go away. I don't know what he's thinking, but. 
**2:**
They just don't get the eyes for it. Because even the housekeeping there was a disaster when I got there. You know, just a tidy job site. 
**0:**
What did the cleaner tell you? 
**2:**
I. I'm still waiting to hear back from Jack, but he. He talked to Andrew Mulder. He sent a message saying Andrew Mulder told him he wanted cleaning on the. At night or on the weekends. And I sent him a message to send me the contact info, and he said he already had it handled. So I called him and he said that he talked to the cleaners and they can't make it. They would cover the windows. So I told him to get some local window companies going and I'm looking for some and to set up the laborers to come on Monday and Tuesday to clean. And then anything that needs to be picked up Tuesday night, Jack is going to do himself. 
**0:**
Wait a minute. So you didn't talk to Eric? 
**2:**
No, I have not. Jack called him already? 
**0:**
No, but Jack's the one that called him and he got pissed off and texted Brandon, said, I'm not doing it. You're gonna find someone else. 
**2:**
Yeah, and then Jack called him again. Because right when you and I were talking and I was saying those messages were coming in, I messaged Jack and then he said he called him. He was on the phone with him when he was. When I was sending those messages. 
**0:**
And so they are going to clean? 
**2:**
No, they are not going to clean. They can't make the schedule. They gave our spot for Thursday and Friday of this week away, and they're going to be in Cincinnati next week. So the cleaning guy offered to do the windows, but he can't guarantee when they'll be done. So we're doing what you and I talked about with the laborers and finding a window cleaning company. 
**0:**
All right. 
**2:**
And the cleaner cannot do this weekend either. 
**0:**
Well, again, I would have preferred you to hear that from this guy. I'll call him. Not sure what Jack said to him. 
**2:**
Yeah, that's no problem. I'll call him. 
**0:**
And just. Just get some clarity on it, because I don't. I just don't. I don't know what that kid is. 
**2:**
He's full of shit, from what I can tell, because Andrew called me last night and was pretty upset that he got chewed on for some stuff that he said Jack was let out lying about. And I know that Jack was lying because he lied to me about it too. And then Jack called me last night after, and all he did was cry about worrying about people aren't gonna give him good jobs on the. Like he's not going to get the good jobs on the team. And some ladder he's worried about not getting put up because they think he's not good at a superintendent for this job. And I don't know. He's just crying. 
**0:**
Well, I told him, he called me today. He's like, I just like to know about my review and. And how I'm doing. I said, you know what? I can't really even gauge that until you finish this job because you haven't finished the job. We got these issues. You need to finish this job, and then we can have that conversation. 
**2:**
So I'm gonna told him last night, show us. 
**0:**
Well, exactly. And once it's done, then I'm gonna be. Can Be brutally honest, because I don't care if he says he's leaving. 
**2:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Because I can't have a superintendent that doesn't know what anchor bolts are. Yeah. There's some glaring problems of experience he has. 
**1:**
So I'm pretty sure AJ didn't know what anchor. Anchor bolts were when we got a hold of him. Who, aj, Holly, or. 
**0:**
Oh, rj. Yeah. Yeah. No, he didn't. Well, but that's the problem is, you know, we don't have. Until these other jobs start, a big job where you can put some with experience and then put the. The lower guys. And that's what I was going to tell him, is you don't have the experience to run one of these jobs by yourself without a lot of hand holding, which none of us have time for. But if we get a bigger job and you can go work as an assistant superintendent and learn all this, you know. Yeah, he's. He could learn it. Exactly. RJ didn't know anything. And I don't know if he stuck around long enough there to learn much from us, but that was so funny. Robert Young's like, this ain't gonna be like the past. This guy, he's got to be. To work. He's got to be there. He's gotta. This. I'm like, yeah, whatever. Okay, same thing. Oh, RJ's dad needs his help, and Gaffney's not coming in this week. And like, okay, great. 
**1:**
Yeah, they went to sleep on my conference room table. I mean, what the. 
**0:**
Yeah, so. But that's like, again, we got in my mind, you know, that's one thing. And then. And it's all about, you know, we need to work on when we have our. We're gonna. We're gonna have the kind of a company call it ops meeting. We call that what we have every Monday. But this is an actual. We will sit down. We'll run through the. You know, we can have our job schedule coming up so we can tell everyone, hey, these are the things that are coming up, potential things coming up. We'll go through their. The job descriptions that are more in tune with results versus just activities. Because you can do 50 activities a day, and unless it produces results, all those doing all those activities doesn't do shit. It doesn't help us. It doesn't get anything done. 
**1:**
So, Jesse, instead of having these big, huge ops meetings with all company, it's probably more beneficial to give them, like, listen to what this. Big, shiny things coming up. And this job that we're pricing and that. That Kind of stuff, kind of get their them hopeful and all that stuff and then let Jesse and I do our OPS meetings, our team meetings offline from them. 
**0:**
I mean, you can, I just wanted to, you know, everyone together because number one, if we split up supers and PMs, then they don't, they're not going to understand. For me, it's better that they understand the results that the PMs supposed to have and for the PM, understand the results the superintendent should have and the expectations they have from each other. And I'm talking about, you know, it's just a day or an afternoon zoom meeting. We can have multiple and like, I agree you can dive into the details with the guys after that, but I want, I just don't think everyone here understands really the big picture on how one affects the other and who owns what. 
**1:**
Job to teach them that too, you know, who does what, you know, and in my experience lately is I've had a bunch of seasoned ass superintendents who are badasses and they would pull along these little junior level pms I have. So that's been my experience here lately. We, it appears that all three of us are the ones that are going to pull out these younger kids that are all struggling to pull them all along the finish line is what it appears so far. 
**0:**
Yeah, that's it. Because again, you, we have no one person on each job that's seasoned and strong and knows really everything and can help the other person out. So instead they're trying to do their part or what they think is their part. And they don't really understand, you know, who's the person that's supposed to actually make sure this gets done for whatever's happening, whether it's out in the field or in the office. 
**2:**
So just who owns the task? 
**0:**
Yeah, and it's almost like, you know, you got one task that's Nick, get this material, get it bought, get delivered to the site. You know, but you know, the superintendent, you know, thinking that he doesn't have any involvement in that, but he should still be looking at the submittals, he should still be looking at the materials, understand, you know, what the sub is supposed to be using to put them in and what his finished product looks like. And like those are things that, you know, when the brick mason said they were done and he seen a big gap in the wall, like, then he should say, hey, we're missing something. And you know, Jack, like our superintendent, if I was him, I'd have been the whole time like, why am I Putting in windows. I don't have a shop drawing for. I don't, I don't know. What, what are the details? These are supposed to be put in like. And instead Jack's just like, okay, they put them in, just letting the subs do whatever they want. And the EFIS guy just put the EFIS in, you know, and now we got a problem and we have nothing. We could have gave the ethos guy this, the middle saying. Here's the window, here's the weeps. Put it in. Say, don't block these things. We don't have that. So now it's on us. So now we're gonna end up paying the APIs guy to rip this shit out and fix it. For a job that started out with a great profit margin is now just dwindling down to, you know, we're going to be barely making our 10%. 
**2:**
Where do you think the line is between accommodating inexperience and, and actually working with people that understand these things, at least on a fundamental level? 
**0:**
Well, that's why I don't want to hire anyone right now that isn't someone that's seasoned and experienced. 
**2:**
Well, there's. Yeah, I don't want to hire anyone that's not old school anymore because we need to bring them in to help with these people. Because, I mean, this is nothing but allocating all of our time to basically teaching them how to do anything. Construction management. 
**0:**
Yeah, we have all the APMs and Assistant Supers we need for a while. We need the supers and the PMs. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**2:**
And then if we run into this situation where we got people over titled, we just call the new PM's lead PM's on the projects and those guys do whatever the lead PMs tell them. 
**0:**
We'll set them back to eight PMs. I mean, Kev is an APM, Alex and APM. If Nick needs to go to APM, Glenn, whatever, Jack, he's definitely going to be an assistant superintendent from now on. 
**1:**
But none of these titles makes a. I mean, we can call them whatever. That's not the problem at hand. The problem at hand is we need some studs out there to lead the fucking jobs that can go, yeah, do the shit that we're doing so we can do real management and real, you know, what we're supposed to be doing. So when are those job postings going live to find a real project manager and a real superintendent? 
**0:**
So all I have to do is put a salary range in there? 
**2:**
Yeah, she Just sent us a message since we've been on here that she sent us to them. 
**0:**
Okay, so, Jim, can you tell me what salary range do I need? Because that's what I'm. All I'm going to do is we're going to put this job. Job schedule together and you tell me at like 135. 
**1:**
So I say we go for a PM like 120 to 130 and same thing for a soup. And we can. We'll definitely attract some studs, but. So in the data center world, they're paying project managers like 185, 190. And they're paying freaking senior supes like 270. It's insane what we're competing against right now in the world. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
And then we're wanting traveling people. Correct. 
**0:**
Other than Indy, we're gonna need super here. 
**2:**
That's also a whole different level of experience in the data center world. 
**1:**
Well, they just make up. I could tell you. I'm. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
Centered. God. A building pad for a data center. That's all I've done. And some concrete screen walls. 
**0:**
I built like five data centers. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Back in 2000. Or no, 1997 to 2001. That's before I came to MJ Harris. That's all I did. 
**1:**
I know you burned your eyebrows off because you were lighting fires inside the building. 
**0:**
That's right. So data center, they aren't that complicated. I can't believe they're getting that much money, but. 
**1:**
Oh, they're getting stupid money right now. But so on, so forth. I think that's what the range needs to be like 130 top end for having. 
**2:**
Right on with that, Jim. 
**1:**
All right. 
**0:**
120 to 130. Both of them. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
I'm gonna respond. 
**1:**
Attract a good one. And then we just need to make sure our billable rates are strong enough to absorb that and our GCs are carrying strong enough. How are, how are we putting together GCS and all that stuff? Jesse, Are we just doing a percentage on the job or what are we doing? 
**0:**
We fill it in base. It's kind of customize. We throw the months in there. And then you just figure on the, you know, depending on the size of the job, the percentage of that person's time, if it's smaller. And a PM is going to spend quarter of his time or half of his time on it. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Put it in that way. 
**1:**
Everybody else does. So you are doing it per. You're not putting them. You're not taking a percentage on top. And Hoping for the best. 
**0:**
No, we go in line item per the job. So. Okay, I mean we're looking at, let me look right today, the one we were working on for this new warehouse in Indiana, that one. See here we have. 
**1:**
You're going to need a full soup on it. You can do part time PM if you can. 
**0:**
We were going to do full time PM because based on the job cost we're still just at 5% on GCS. 
**1:**
Okay. And then you can use those billable rates I sent you will cover this manpower number and catch you fee on top on the spin too if you use that billboard rate sheet that I gave you. 
**0:**
Well that's what I want to say is. So we have. You've looked at our estimate. You know, it's the same spreadsheet in every folder. And so we have, you know, a project manager billing rate is 3,515 a week. 3,515 times 52. So that's a hundred, that's billing 182,000 a year. So if we pay him on 30, we'll be making a little money. You know, we have the truck allowance, car allowance, that's figured on a different line. Our superintendent's the same rate. So again we can afford like that's, that's our rate for those guys. So really every job we got we could pay for one of those guys, big or small. 
**1:**
Okay, I'm. I'm gonna send you my GC spreadsheet that I use too. Mine has places for subsistence and all this other crazy there that you know. And then it'll calculate the fee on your burn for what your billable rate is versus what you're actually paying them to. 
**0:**
Did you guys do just a monthly per diem amount throughout a town or did you pay actual. 
**1:**
So what we do is online item a monthly per diem rate but I actually pay what they pay. I basically pay their rent. So I save money on that too. 
**0:**
You mean you pay them so much for food and whatever and then. 
**1:**
No, I pay their rent. So I pay the rent, their utilities and then give them a couple hundred extra bucks and that's all I give them. 
**0:**
That's it. Damn. What's that add up to? A month? 
**1:**
So typically on my jobs on my senior level guys, I cover, I carry 135 or excuse me, 35k. $3,500 a month. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**1:**
For my senior level guys. And that even. That'll include a trip home for them too. 
**0:**
Yeah, we, I think we get one trip a month. For the supers. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Of course it's a little different, you know, especially our shorter jobs like the one Jackson, we can't. And looking at it now, maybe we should have rented an apartment. But like the Airbnbs, you know, sometimes they're five grand a month. So does that figure out a better way to do that? I don't know what that is, but I like the MJ way. They just gave me 2500amonth back in the day and let me do what I wanted with it. 
**2:**
I got four grand today from Leighton or a month. 
**0:**
How much? Four. Four thousand. 
**2:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
But I agree completely with MJ Way because then you don't have any dispute about it. And some of these travel homes are. Some of these travels that I pay are astronomical. 
**0:**
It's just the tax way though. You can't. They have. It's figured as income. Unless it's a reimburse, basically. So whether. You'd have to. You just have to do it somehow where they went through a first month and then they get reimbursed for being out of town, you know what I mean? Because they tax it differently. 
**1:**
Well, what happens, Jesse, now is. So the per diem is for one year. Once you go past one year on one job, then it's taxable. And then you have to up the subsistence amount you give them for the taxes. So it's like 25% up if the job goes over a year. But yeah, the MJ way is actually the cheaper way than the way that I told you. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
Because then you can negotiate. You can negotiate their sub. And I mean, I hate to say it, but kind of fuck them a little bit. 
**0:**
Yeah. We're gonna have to update our out of town policy then as well if we change that. Because obviously you can't change it mid job on a guy unless they want to. I don't know. That'd be up to them. But. All right, so looking at. See what else we're gonna go over here. 
**2:**
So this thing about Glenn too. Sorry. 
**0:**
Well, that is all about, you know, that same job description we need to modify because that'll have like the results that we're looking for, not just a bunch of tasks. And that's how like getting those results is how you can come back and we just. Can you. So what we should do here, let me open up this. I want to share it and we'll just. I'll create a new file and I'll share it between us. We can all throw our ideas on it of what to add or change to make it better. That way we're all working on the same document, you know what I mean? On the one drive. 
**1:**
Cool. 
**0:**
See here. And we'll do it. I'll create one for each. Let's see here. It. 
**1:**
So, Jesse, your goal right now is to. 
**0:**
I lost you guys for a second. Did you see your goal? 
**1:**
So your goal for what you want to do right now is you want to assess the guys you have at hand, right? 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
And then you want to get a performance plan to make them better, to grow them to the next level. And then the following thing is you want to see what all works coming up to get more employees to staff the future projects. Correct? 
**0:**
Correct. Yeah. We fill out all those projects, we'll put some expected start date durations on it and then put who we think it needs, staffing wise. And then. Yeah, then we'll have and their targets for the next year. 
**1:**
So there's one more thing that we do which is a little bit different than what you're talking about. So we actually. So we take all of the employees and we judge them. I know that's fucking weird and inappropriate, whatever, but we call it a block nine and we put everybody in a box. Like we gonna keep them, we're gonna fire them. Do we see them growing in potential in the next couple years? Do we see them, you know, or maybe it's the next five years, we see them bumping up or do we feel them as a future leader? So we, we also do that too, just to kind of judge them, what everybody feels about everybody. And then we do employee evaluations and get them on a management plan of how to get them better. 
**0:**
Okay, that's a once a year thing. 
**1:**
Yeah, we do. We do evaluations once a year, and then we do a block nine once a year too. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**1:**
And the problem that it sounds like that you're already having is Glenn called you, who called you, Jack called you to ask how he's doing and that kind of crap. Yeah, yeah. That's just part of being the leader. They're gonna always ask that kind of crap to you, and you're gonna be dealing with that more than you're dealing with construction. Once we get an ass ton of people right. 
**0:**
Oh, yeah. 
**2:**
I got my field psychology degree years ago in Alaska. 
**1:**
Yeah, I'm still thinking I'm lacking on that. I think I have personality challenges internally. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**2:**
Yeah. I have kind of a hard time being in that position when it gets gnarly and they're focusing on that instead of finishing their ship. Like right now? 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
Well, yeah. I mean I can't. Like if I was in that position, I was struggling to get a job done. Last thing in the world I would want is to know what people thought of me, get the thing done and hopefully make bring about a bad enough outcome that you know how you are. I don't. Something that pissed me off two weeks ago. I don't remember today. 
**2:**
So I'm sure any one of the guys that was involved remembers it. 
**0:**
Probably. I don't know. 
**1:**
I told Jesse how he was mean to me freaking 20 years ago the other day. 
**0:**
I can't believe I said that to you, jparker. 
**1:**
I know it was hurtful. 
**0:**
It's hurtful. 
**2:**
Did you guys break up already? 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
No, I protected. 
**0:**
Took a different job. 
**1:**
Yeah, I protected him from getting killed by a 12 foot tall Hungarian. 
**0:**
That's right. Just didn't know proper mirror etiquette. 
**1:**
Yeah. You did not have your swastika drawn correctly that day. 
**0:**
Yeah. So I just linked you guys all we got. Estimator. So that's the other thing. Jim is like Estimator. Like have you got any interest from your guys? 
**1:**
I don't. Don't have any interest right now. I'm gonna call another guy. So there's a drywall estimator that I think I can grab. But I just don't know his ability to do GC work. But he can estimate. Should I. 
**0:**
Some drywall? Yeah, that's more of a takeoff person. We need someone that knows how to. 
**1:**
Oh, I. I know, I know. Get the self interest and get the bids and scope them out and make sure that everybody's Apples. Apples. And make sure you have everything covered. Yeah, yeah, I know. We need. 
**0:**
Yeah, but there's no one at late. 
**1:**
No, not right now. Not right now. I'm trying to talk him into it, but he's kind of. 
**0:**
Ben. 
**1:**
He's just hired him about six months ago and he. He's awful soft compared to what I thought he was going to be. He's says I, so I'm sorry. More than he gets done. 
**0:**
I got you. He's not someone you'd want to hire. 
**1:**
I'd want to hire him. He would definitely do good on one or two jobs. You can't have him doing multiple things. You can't give him like seven jobs to do at once. He can only do two at the time at the most. Yeah, but he does too like you know, 150 million dollar jobs at once. 
**0:**
Yeah. Okay. And then. But when these jobs like Savannah say or paradise or this Union Kentucky job, when those are like, we have those dates lined out, you think you'd have no problem getting supers and PMs for those? 
**1:**
No, I don't. I've already got a super mine to do that one. 
**0:**
Okay. 
**2:**
Jesse, is there anybody on the existing team you think would make it better in the estimating world? 
**1:**
Alex seems to have interest in it. 
**0:**
Yeah, I mean, he's just not very experienced. So as long as take some training up and. 
**2:**
If you had a good estimator to follow the lead of. 
**1:**
So, I mean, for real, like Paradise Isle, is it about to go down here shortly? 
**0:**
I think so. 
**1:**
And then Savannah is. They got funding in place. 
**0:**
That they're. That they still need to get, but again, until the city approves it, they got something to get funded. It's kind of waiting on that first. 
**1:**
What are we waiting on for Savannah again? Say that again. 
**0:**
The city, they've approved the land for the collective, but they have not approved the land for the hotel yet. Okay, as soon as we get that, then we can move forward. And just today, Jim, what do you think? So the city guy came back to call Brandon when we were in a meeting earlier, and he said somewhere someone gave him a price of 12 million for the whole project, the Seminole Collective. But they wanted like $5 million for the parking lot, which seems high. I put, I did an estimate. Let's see where I got that. And I said it'd be $2 million for the parking and see what I did. And they said that works, but if the parking lot costs $5 million, the city's not going to pay that. But the, the job doesn't work. 
**1:**
All right, so Seminole connect. What is that again? 
**0:**
So let me share this with you. So Seminole collected. 
**1:**
So this is, this is the one that we looked at. Okay, yeah, yeah. So in this little bitty parking lot, he's saying $5 million. She got a little bitty parking lot. 
**0:**
Exactly. 
**1:**
All right, so let's go down the road of like, do we have a soil support for that? 
**0:**
Do we know what we're getting into? Well, what I can tell you from. Let me find it here. Let's see. 
**1:**
Because that seems like a whole lot of money for a part of it. I know you're storm structures and yada, yada, yada, but so it looks very small. 
**0:**
Well, this site. Let me go back to this PDF. So we have the total site is basically 11.3 acres, 11.4 acres. And so the, the pink. Yeah, the pink is the county, and that's the that's the golf course and that so that's six acres. So there's a 2.2 acre parking lot. And I did see how I did this. 
**1:**
Well I came up with 85,000 foot parking lot is what I came up with. 
**0:**
Triangle for 2.2 acre parking lot. It's 850. Okay. Is that what you said? 
**1:**
I think. Let me verify. 
**0:**
You're breaking up, Jim. Yeah, I really think it is. Okay. So here and you're breaking up real bad. I don't know if it's my connection or yours but I went in and we estimated just to do this was for the parking lot new version. So I put but 383 for stormwater. This is not pavement markings pavement. So I figured it would be estimated 1.8. That's for the parking lot figure and we'd have some general electrical. I just had some light poles that buy fed off the utility and I directly feed wires. When it's a city parking lot. Yeah it's so and they said our budget works for the parking lot. So we have the. We just going to have to double verify And I just like normal. I just went and found the local average square foot price things and came up with this. So so now we have look at est so this so we don't have one yet for the So I haven't done an estimate for the. The volleyball and the actual complex. So if do we think we could get the city at budget by next week mid next week for this for the putt putt course. This entertainment area which you know now like we went through and redid the Port Collective and so I'm thinking we can use a similar. Similar concept. I don't know if they're tied to the containers per se but like this entertainment area. Like this is a big steel structure with the covered stage and seating area. And then they're going to have some. See here. Yeah. This is what we originally got from. I kind of cut and pasted this in there. This form here shows you everything they initially came up with. But we've modified it a little bit because the parking used to be all along the front. We wanted to get rid of that just park the parking down here. 
**2:**
Is this the latest revision, Jesse? 
**0:**
No, this is an old. This is an old drawing I'm trying to find define not sure why it's not in here. Damn it. Where is the damn original drawing? Here, let me take this. 
**2:**
It. 
**0:**
Okay. So this was the original plan when they first came to us. They had the Putt, putt. Down here they had this parking along the front all up here. And then these were pickleball courts. These were volleyball courts. Originally they had two buildings. The city said, that's way too much. They just need one that's a lot smaller than shown. You got the stage here. They showed entries off this side, but I think we're not doing that. We just come off of this main road in the front, you know, into the parking lot. So that's the old one and then this is the current one. And we're planning on like one thing I told them, I said we're building all this out, but we have no storm pond. So to not have to put in a bunch of storm capture systems. They're supposed to be giving us this property that we can put in a big detention pond to handle the whole site. 
**1:**
Where's the detention pond? Scroll up, Mouse. Again, where you put detention? 
**0:**
Right here. Can you see my screen? 
**1:**
Yeah, I see it right there. 
**0:**
It's here. 
**1:**
That little swell. 
**0:**
Yeah. See this? I put proposal based on using this area for stormwater retention. 
**1:**
Okay, perfect. 
**0:**
We were going to put two accesses off this East Lake Mary Boulevard into the parking lot. This, like when we talk to them afterwards, they're like, well, this road never will go in, but it. Drainage canal currently. So we would just put in some culverts for people to get across here is the plan. And you know, two. They want to. Yeah. For people to park here and walk into everything over here. And then like inside of here, they just put up bleachers, like along the back sides here, you know, so some of those. So it's just, it's general. Like, just need to confirm our parking lot number. Confirm what we're going to build the rest of it for, including like this city building. All it is, is a. I think they wanted 4,000 square feet. It would have restrooms, you know, public restrooms, and then a shop to store because they store all the volleyballs and all that, whatever equipment they let people use. You can see how they got all the seating, like in here to watch everything. I think these are bleachers because they put the championship match in here. So I guess they're courting the volleyball guy. They. They have four courts that they run all the games on, and then they use this one for the final. So looking at that, Jim, we. You know, I've already started and had the estimate for the parking lot. Just need to verify some numbers and then we'd have to fill out and price up the rest of this or budget it, I should say. The volleyball guy. Brandon's getting in touch with that guy so that he can give us the contacts for the. There's. He has like two companies that do these all the time. And we'll get them to give us some numbers on what the volleyball court will cost and then we'll have to just budget for this city building and everything else that's out here on site, which is the second page, tells you what all those numbers are. 
**2:**
There's that Conex building thing I made in the picture folder too, if you need any references for those container buildings to put them. 
**0:**
Yeah, okay. 
**2:**
There's some Conex cafes and shit in there. So they're doing away with the big theater, outdoor concert and all that stuff. That was on the last revision. 
**0:**
No, that's still in there. 
**2:**
Oh, okay. 
**0:**
We just moved things around a bit. Got rid of the pickleball courts. There's one original there. This is the current basically plan. 
**2:**
Yeah, last time I saw it, mini golf was down by the parking lot. 
**0:**
Well, originally it was down here, but I mean, it's a couple things. And it was. Number one, there was like a different use. Like this is the cities and this is a city or county, vice versa. And so like these two separating from the. The land, like these are county. That. This. I guess the county's letting the city use that land for their purpose and the city's letting us use this land. They're able to sign that away for, you know, $0 for revenue from taxes and shit. So that's why we wanted to fit all of ours, putt putt and all these things on this parcel. The blue. 
**1:**
Is this a design build job or this just. 
**0:**
Yeah, yeah, we're design building the whole thing. 
**1:**
And just. Stupid question. So what about if we give them a low. 
**0:**
Ball? 
**1:**
We gotta come up some. 
**0:**
Well, we know they've got 12 million. We know if we can do the parking lot for two and say the volleyball costs us 400,000 and then we can build out the golf and containers for. See, that's 2.4 or no, 18 on 8. 2 point, say 25. So if we can build like this stage, I'm, you know, talking with the steel guy, the steel structure and foundations, probably a million bucks. These containers are going to end up being. I don't get pricing on them. Or are we going to be spending like $200,000 per container? And then the putt putt course, say that cost half a million. Because if I didn't really. If we can build 6.750 like everything else. If we got 2.2 for the parking, volleyball builder for seven, then we're within budget. And like, one of the things. There's an existing storm ditch that runs through the property. Like this approximately. We would have to put in like some RCP to run through here so we can build over the top of it. 
**1:**
Okay. 
**0:**
But that's like, where. Go ahead. 
**1:**
Building footprint. Is that a building? Is the purple building or is that just. 
**0:**
Well, these are little containers, like the purple. This is sand volleyball courts. 
**1:**
Okay, so that's outside then, right? It's not inside? 
**0:**
That's right. Like the building is over here. 
**1:**
Okay, perfect. Okay. All right. Yeah. Yeah, we're good now. Yeah. 
**0:**
So, like, other than the volleyball post, we'd have to miss that, like the support posts, because those will be buried down. And you know, they. That would be the only thing we'd have to work around to lay out to not miss some volleyball court and those nets. But the. And then we're looking at like all of this. If this is all. I mean, I don't know if it's a drainable turf system. If we did that just to cut down on the additional stormwater requirements. Because if you look at it like credit for all of this asphalt road as far as impermeable surface. So, like, that's going to help us when we go, you know, where is it? No, this road goes away. Basically. We'll just make that a ditch with some culverts with some passovers. So then, like, other than our little buildings here, we're not going to be adding a whole lot of storm retention needed. It's mostly just this city parking lot. So that's why if we have this pond over here, a detention pond there, that means like all of this city lock and just dump through this pond and do an outfall over here back into the. The natural channels running right through here. Cool. Currently, it comes across the road right here and then it drains along here. So that's the existing water flow we got to keep in place. And if we run this culvert through the site, I don't know what we'd have to do to tie into it. Some stuff. But, like, if we kept this mostly grassed, all these areas is grass except for the stage and some of the containers. We can do wood, you know, best way to build like a wood surface for people walking around, keep it dirt underneath. So that's. I mean, and the biggest thing on this parking lot, the unknown, is the amount of fill we'll have to bring in to build this area up because it is low. Like here's the topo survey. This is 13 and 15. 13, 15. And the road out here like the sidewalks at 18, that's 15, 8, you know, here's the. Here's the sidewalks at 18. So most of this is 3, 4, 5 foot of fill in this whole area. Yeah, as you can see down like this ditch is 10 foot deep to that. And then you bring it up to close to 19, you're 13 foot down in this ditch. So this may end up requiring. They may want to just throw a pipe down through here to transfer that water or not just be a deep ditch. Here's the ditch run along here and then it's more of a swale along this front here. Still pretty low. There's like 10 foot drop from the street to the bottom of this. That's why we kept all of our construction like the, this new plan. Other than this parking lot, we stayed out of this drainage ditch along the front. 
**1:**
Looks like the whole site is a import. 
**0:**
Well, there's a. And I don't know that. I mean, do we even need. Is it a bad thing that we're a little lower than surrounding roads? 
**1:**
I don't think so. 
**0:**
So we can leave this. So this is all 16.7 17. This side over here is low. The other side of this Canal, it's all 13. So yeah, this side may need some unless we just leave it low again. 
**1:**
But you could cut that 17 down to 13 and flip over the other part. 
**0:**
It is true. Especially because we're not going to have. I don't think we're going to have this access road around the back. Doesn't make sense. So yeah, possibly, you know, when they dig out this volleyball, they got to go down 18 inches or so to put in that volleyball sand. So all of this area, I mean that's a massive amount of, you know, a foot and a half over four acres. I mean that probably would fill this end in maybe. 
**1:**
Yeah. 
**0:**
We'Ll just make it an underwater putt putt course. 
**1:**
There's more water hazards. That's fine. 
**0:**
Yeah, it would be cool. Who has a putt putt course that's like solid surrounded by water? What if we could do our detention pond with an elevated putt putt deck? Just put it all up on piles. I'm serious. Other than little kids falling into it all the time. 
**1:**
Yeah, but they like that shit. They like the water features. 
**0:**
Yeah. 
**1:**
That green ass water and. 
**0:**
All. 
**1:**
Right, so you're gonna turn in 11 million. 
**0:**
What's that? 
**1:**
You gonna turn in 11 million and let it rip and see what happens? 
**0:**
No, we need to be around. Well, there's. There you go. Like the city, you know, they don't control the budget for the collective. But if we could get this done for 7 million, we can do the parking lot for 1.8 and we can do the volleyball for 4 there. If we can confirm those prices. I think we basically have. Are in good shape. But this building. That is true. We got this building. We didn't figure. So 4,000 square feet. And that's going to be very simple. Structure can just be CMU walls, truss roof, bathrooms and vending. I mean, we should be able to get that for 150 bucks a foot while they're on site. 
**1:**
That's 675. 
**0:**
Four, five, two. Six times. Yeah. 675,000. That's probably too much money for simple little building like that. So, Jim, just crunching numbers. Thinking of like, how long do you think Me? A few hours a day. You? A couple hours a day. How long will it take us to get this thing together? 
**1:**
I think you could do the whole thing in six months. 
**0:**
Well, no, I'm talking getting the price, getting them a budget that's we're comfortable with. 
**1:**
Yeah, probably about six or eight hours for sure. 
**0:**
So by next Wednesday? 
**1:**
Yeah, I'll call a dirt guy to see what he can do. Give me a takeoff and see what he can get going. 
**0:**
Okay, perfect. And you do you have you found this folder. Do you have access to it? 
**1:**
Yeah, I do. 
**0:**
Okay. Yeah, it's this one. 
**1:**
And I sent that house off to somebody today. 
**0:**
Okay. All right, well, I'll go check with Brandon. We gotta leave here in a second for this goodwill event. But yeah, if you get a dirt guy looking at it, that'd be awesome. 
**1:**
All right, Sounds good. Thanks, man. 
**0:**
All right. See you guys. 
**2:**
Thank you. See you guys.

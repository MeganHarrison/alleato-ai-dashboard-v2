## Full Transcript


**Jesse Remillard:**
It. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Sa. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Hi, Andrew. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I forgot about the meeting. I am walking out of Lowe's, but I could talk and drive. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
I don't care that you forgot about me, Andrew. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
So I couldn't find anything. Elated, I looked up ADA's requirements, NDA requirements for the ramp on bolting it to the ground. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Huh. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I couldn't find anything that specifically called it out. However residential it's required. But something tells me it should be bolted to the concrete. And I do not have a hammer drill put Tapcons in the concrete. AJ might if I pick it up on the weekend. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, Sunbelt also has them. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
The steel guys will be on site Tuesday. They could always do it too. I mean, that ramp is pretty damn secure. It's just I have a feeling they're going to want to see that voltage of the ground. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Sorry, I'm sending a message. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Feel good. Okay. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Getting you your volleyball polls for Westfield. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Oh, nice. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So, I'm sorry, repeat everything you just said. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
So I think I cannot find anything specifically word that says it has to be bolted to the ground. However, knowing Bloomington, I think it's smart to bolt it to the ground, especially since it's not gonna cost that much money. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
I would fully agree with you. And we. I don't think. And you can tell because you're there, but I don't think we need to go crazy with the anchors. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
No, I mean, that thing doesn't even move. It's not sketchy at all when you walk on it. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Like I think every other one switching sides. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah. The cost to do it is so minimal. Might as well knock it out. So. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. And you should be able to rent a hammer drill from Sunbelt, unless you can score one over the weekend. You just got to make sure that you have the right bit for the size Titan you're using. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I've never used a hammer drill. I mean, it's probably pretty easy to use, so. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, they're super easy to use. You just have to make sure, like when you buy the Titans, it'll say what bolt, what bit size to use. You just have to make sure you have that size bit. And there's a little. What's that? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Is that just so when you're putting in the tapcon, it has something to hold on to. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. So these aren't Tapcons, These are Titans. These are like Tapcon's big brother. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Gotcha. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
They're probably going to be galvanized and they're going to have kind of funky looking shallow threads on them that are really spaced far Apart, kind of. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Do they sell those at Lowe's? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yes. Oh, yeah. So on the box, it'll say, because it's probably better for you to go get the drill first and see what bits AJ has, because you may. You may have to buy the bit too. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay. Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Because those holes have to be the right size. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay. Yeah. I'm sure AJ can give me a lesson on it, too, and you two can show me. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, yeah, I can explain it to you. And the one thing you want to make sure you do is measure the holes you have to drill in. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Because that's gonna be concrete. Bits have, like, a little spade on the tip of them. It's a little diamond carbide piece. So you want to make sure you don't. You're smaller than the hole. You have to drill with that, because if you strip that off when you go through the metal, you won't be able to drill in the concrete very well. Usually you mark this shit out and drill it and then put it back. But, yeah, it'll. It's real easy. But I would get the. I would measure the holes that you have to work with, and then you can let me know. I can tell you what size tightens to get. Or you can just go to load. I was in the. Just find one that's smaller because the bit that they. Yeah, the bit they tell you to use is going to be the same, basically the same width as the thread size on the bolt. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Gotcha. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And then I just got the trying stuff figured out for the city submission. So I have all three documents that the city is requiring us to submit. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
You have all three done? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, I have them all in my email. Kate just sent me the last one that I need. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Already in the drawings. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
What's that? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
With the addition of the ADA ramp and the drawing? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, yeah. There's the addition of the ADA ramp, and then there's a picture of the parking lot with the ADA spaces and the property line. And then there's the amended lease agreement. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
That went quick. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. So what is Jack's thing he was talking about earlier about being worried they're going to lose their lease? Is that like, worst case, doomsday stuff? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I think. I think they just have to be out of their building at a certain day. And I think that date is coming up. And. And Jack's just worried if we get delayed, Goodwill is going to. Sorry, one second. We'll stop the highway. I think he's just worried if Goodwill's lease is up, they get kicked out, then they have nowhere to go and they can't move into the new space, then people are gonna lose money and stuff like that. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
I don't. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I don't think it's gonna go that far. I think, yeah, it was just a worst case scenario. I'd be shocked if the city planning department wouldn't let us have a TCO because that dude won't sign his permit. That permit we're sending him for Pizza Hut. I don't see why that would hold up a tco? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
They won't even. I don't think they'll even let us schedule the inspection without having that document executed. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I still feel like. I still feel like there was miscommunication with that inspector and that if we. I feel like she was. I took it as if you're going to continue to have stuff there. You need to have that permit, not, oh, we're going to backdate you. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
That's what I mean. Because that permit technically has been executed since the 18th of August, and we don't have it signed yet. Yeah, we'd have to ask Jack. I don't know where he is, but he said that when they were on site, they told him that. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah, I. I feel like it was maybe just miscommunication, but we're so far down this rabbit hole now, there's nothing we can really do. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Well, I'm hoping to chat. Like, that's why I kind of was hoping Jack would show up on this because. Is he with you? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
No, I'm texting. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Because I think we can try to find that out today. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
That lady's out of the office, so I think. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
What's that? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I think she's. The inspector's out of office today. Jack tried to reach out and you got an automated reply that she was out of office. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, so Jennifer's out because we still have Jackie or Jody or whatever her name is. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Jack, do you know if they're. Are we able to get a hold of them? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, Jack's here now. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, I'm here. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Hey, Jack. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Only. Hey. Only one I've talked to has been Jennifer. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
She one of the two that was on site? 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. The other one is Joy Brown. I'm not sure if she. If she can make that call. If Jennifer can make that call. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Are you able to send me their number? Yeah, I could try giving them a call. 
**Jack Curtin:**
You know what I was thinking? Taste Friday. We just poured. Did the concrete guy mention how soon we could back up on that apron at the dock door? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
It needs a week. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, boy. Okay. Why Andrew Molder's asking me if he can use the dock door on Tuesday for that conveyor. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
On Tuesday? 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, yeah, I think that's a hard no. But you can text him back and just tell him that I'm going to be calling him shortly. Do you have your computer in there with you, Andrew? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
No, I'm almost back. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, I thought you were sitting in the parking lot. I mean, Bloomington's five minutes long. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
It's not true. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
No, it's definitely not. I couldn't believe how long it took me to get that site from that Airbnb. So, Jack, one thing I just finished up right before this call was Kate Polak at Kimleyhorn got back to me, and she sent me the three documents that have the information the city wanted about that ramp and the ADA parking spaces. So that's ready to be submitted. So in the past, has Nick usually sent that stuff in? 
**Jack Curtin:**
It sounded like Jennifer and George just wanted to email to them. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
That's what I'm asking. Who usually sent that kind of stuff to them? Was it you or was it Jet Nick? 
**Jack Curtin:**
It was. It was like a combo of Nick and Jesse before I even, like, mobilized on site. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's. That's fine. I just need to know who to send it to. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, okay. Yeah. Do you want Jennifer and Joy's email? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Oh, it's Joy. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. There's a Jennifer and there's a Joy. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. I have Joy Brown's email. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Okay. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And I have Jennifer Burrell's email. Yep. 
**Jack Curtin:**
That's who I've been working with. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And who's Jacqueline Scanlon? 
**Jack Curtin:**
I've not met her, had any contact with her. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. She was on the other email chain that you sent me that Jesse wrote all those red comments in. I just didn't know because they were talking to her, so. Oh, yeah, yeah, I'll figure that part out. I'm going to try to still get a hold of them today. Okay. Same form. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Let's see. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Did you text Andrew that I was calling him? Yes, I did. 
**Jack Curtin:**
I did text him back. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, Andrew, let me know when you get back so we can get the schedule knocked out so I can call Andrew. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Just down the road from there. This place has turned into a madhouse on a Friday night. Looks like I'm staying here. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
I know why you wanted to go down there, Andrew. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Smells like a fish market here. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, that's like that place in Seattle. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
That just smells like death. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
I'm from a fishing town, so I know what it smells like. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Should be Two minutes to two minutes. God, I've had this thing stuck in my tooth all day. Oh. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Jack. If you got running around and stuff to do on site, you can just jump back on this call when Andrew gets there. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Now I got a second right now. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I got some good. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Right now. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Nothing. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Major. Yeah. Most of them gone. Electricians gone. Painter's still. Still working. Let me just. Why? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Why? 
**Jack Curtin:**
I just said the word. Painters reiterate to their foreman. Please only focus on the canopy this weekend. If you have it happens to be time after the canopy's done, then sure paint the rest of the exterior. But please only focus on the canopy. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Good call. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Please prioritize. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Meaning gutters have to be gutters downspouts have key installed Monday. And then they those that roofing company confirmed it on site and on the phone. You come on, move. So that schedule, whenever something gets done, I'm going to turn the task green and I'll send it out at the end of the day. United actually two things. So Diamond Glass, they gave us a number for exterior and interior sealant. Because all that block, all those there's like all these joints or where the block meets the brick, it's exposed. So Diamond Glass gave us the number to seal all those cracks. We'll need to get that approved. And then according to United, they can't mobilize until September 27th, 2022. 22nd. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So that's something he. So. 
**Jack Curtin:**
And then also too, Zach mentioned that Tristan would need 10 days for that waterfall. But Tristan said he'd only need just the rest of that whole week was five days. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Five. Five days. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 
**Jack Curtin:**
And then when the masons come out to do their prep work at the canopy, I mean at the dock door area up high, they're going to condense even more of this area on Monday and even get more stuff out of here. So then come Monday, we'll know even more of exactly how much area we're actually fencing in. It may not be as much as we think. Yeah, we do need that caulking change order approved. Nick was under the impression that Inline was doing it. And then Inline told me that they don't even specialize in doing something like that. I gotta take this. One second. I'm sorry. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
All right, Jesse, I'm back. I'll share. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Jesse, Dawson just texted me. So. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
He'S asking about the if I called Andrew and what the update is. So. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay. Here, we'll get through this in two minutes. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
We'Ll fly through this. All right. Computer frozen. Come on. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Hey, Jack, are you back? 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So is this CO for diamond glass? We need the exterior and the interior. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, I mean, definitely the exterior. I'm not sure if we definitely need the interior. I mean, Andrew Mulder asked me, are we gonna caulk that? Like the gap in between the block and the brick? I mean, it looks kind of bad, but I don't know. I'm not knowledgeable enough to know. Like. Yes, that needs to be caulked. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Andrew, what do you think? Have you looked at it? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I mean, the outside, it's a pretty. I mean, I would. I would think they're going to want it sealed. I mean, it's. You can see light coming through it when you walk by it at a certain angle. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, I just don't. I don't know. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
There's Tyvek, but I've never seen a building not be sealed here. Let's get to the schedule. Jesse and I'll send you pictures of what it looks like. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Can you see my screen? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yep. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay, so ethos at canopy columns. Done. Lights at canopy, done. They're working on the signage right now. All of Siemens stuff is done. I need to call that guy. Fire alarm certificate. Right. When we get off this, Siemens provide extra attic storage. They're bringing that. They brought some today. They're bringing more when they come back out next week. Jack and I'll take the fence out. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Let's skip to the part where. What's going to be left to do on Monday for the tco? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay. Install canopy gutters and downspouts. That's confirmed to happen on Monday. Speakers. Just. They didn't like the extra hanging wire. Those are being installed right now. They're still. I think they're still here. Off to go. Check. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Who'S still here. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
It's Goodwill Sub for the speakers. Microphone. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, yeah. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
That should be fine. They're rock and roll in there. Easy access railings. Haven't been able to get a hold of them all day. Make sure the city has all requested documents. This hydrostatic test is not a CO or a TCO requirement, but it's something extra that needs to be done according to Siemens. If anything, if the inspector asks, we've had it done. Forming poor curb back a building that's on Monday. That's needed for egress. Clear path egress. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So curb is part of it and that's it. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
That's all that's going to happen. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And curve is on Monday. Yeah. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
So anything. Hello, is tco. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, so for tco, canopy gutters and downspouts, the Goodwill, sub speakers, easy access, rails and curb. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yes, that's everything. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. All right. So can you guys just put this stuff in like we talked about? Add in the vault and all that fun stuff for the co. Yeah, that's already in. Okay. Yeah. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Wait, wait, wait. What was that thing above tco? Inspection. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Rock solid masonry. Oh, this schedule here is everything. Everything left. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Everything for tco. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
No, this schedule has both combined. I have a separate TC schedule, but this has everything on it. Yeah, here's. Okay, here's just the tco. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Tco, Tuesday. This is Monday. Canopy, gutters, speakers, easy access railing. Submit all request documents to city. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And do we need that? When do we need to get that done by Jack? 
**Jack Curtin:**
I mean, the inspectors didn't say anything about that. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
I just. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
No, Andrew Mulder wanted it done, I think. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, he did ask if the inside was going to be caulked. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Did you tell them how much the change order cost? 
**Jack Curtin:**
No, this was before I got the cost number. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, so would that be an owner change order on this job? 
**Jack Curtin:**
That is a good question for Nick. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
So inline had this in their scope. They signed to it and now they're claiming, oh, we misunderstood the scope. We don't want to do it or we can't do it. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, it's so. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
So it's kind of Nick's. Either Nick's fault for not explaining it to them, or they're trying to back out of it. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah, or them or their fault for not interpreting what Nick was asking of them. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Is it something we need a decision on today? 
**Jack Curtin:**
No. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
No. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay, so if that can back burner till Monday, we can we have a few minutes with it to figure it out. Because this. It's hard with Jesse and Nick both gone. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Oh, Jesse Dawson's gone today? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah, he's off today. So right now let's just focus on the stuff we need to do to get the tco. And then anything that is unknown or open like that SC Fab change order. Yeah, and then we have these. Yeah, and we have these TNM tickets that we got to deal with. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yes, all Glenmark says that. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. So you got Glenmarks and then you got Deems incoming. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I don't know why Glenmark like. It's also not. We also gotta remember Glenmark broke that mirror. So I'll have to include that. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
What are they. What are they doing about that? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Jack? What did Griffin say to you? 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Jack? 
**Jack Curtin:**
Clean. Yeah, I'm reading one of their change orders right now. Yeah, he said, what did what did Glen Mark say about the mirror? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah, didn't you send him Griffin, a picture of the cracked mirror? 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. I mean, he took ownership for it and was just like, well, let me know, like, when you get another one out and we'll. We'll get it. We'll get it handled. But he's. I haven't got a cost yet from the mirror company. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I'm getting a call. I want to see who this is. One second. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So you guys go ahead and figure that out. I gotta get going because I gotta try to get a hold of the city, and then I got to get back with Jesse. So I'm going to talk to the city about, can we schedule our inspection for Tuesday? And then I'll see about submitting these. These documents to them and then find out if they're going to make us have that affidavit sign from the neighborhood before they let us schedule. 
**Jack Curtin:**
10, 4. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So I'll circle back with you guys in a little bit, then just make some notes of that stuff. Like that change order for the Cauch. We got to dig into that. And that's something that we will do. We'll. We'll loop Jesse in when we need to after. Because I want to look at that contract. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
That was. That was our fire alarm guy. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
What'd he say? Is he giving you that certificate? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
So it's the second time he's ever had to do it. So he's coming on site Monday, and his operations manager or whatever is gonna explain him how to do it while he's here, because he was like, I could do it for you right now and send it to you, but it could be wrong and you'd fail inspection. So he's like 100% guarantee you I will be there Monday to get it done Monday morning, which is fine. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And that gets us the certification. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. Okay. So 100%, we will be done with everything ready for an inspection at 8am Tuesday morning. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yes. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Oh, we're not doing an evening one. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Why would we do an evening one if everything's gonna be done on Monday? I'm saying, will we be ready at 8:00am Not. We're scheduling it for 8:00am oh, yeah. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
I mean, has this done Monday? Nine. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Eight. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Yeah. Okay. 
**Jack Curtin:**
Yeah. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Because I. I would. Yeah, I would still try to get it for like, a little at least late morning or early afternoon to give some time just for cleanup and stuff in the morning. But, yeah, I'll take what I can get. If we can get it for Tuesday. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yep, we'll be good. We'll be good Tuesday. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
Okay. All right, guys. Thank you. I will catch up with you Monday morning, and then, Andrew, can you look into those Titans? 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Yeah, I'm gonna call AJ on my way home. I think we'll probably be out of here in, like, an hour. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
And I'll be home all weekend if you have a question on them. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Okay, thank you. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
So just. Just let me know. Shoot me, text, whatever. 
**Andrew Cannon:**
Wait. 
**Jesse Remillard:**
We'll do. All right, thanks, guys.

## High Priority Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

*These issues significantly impact user experience or development workflow*

### 1. React 19 Compatibility Issues
**Status**: üîç Under Investigation  
**Discovered**: January 10, 2025  
**Impact**: Development stability, some third-party library incompatibilities

**Description**:
React 19 + Next.js 15 combination causes occasional compatibility issues with certain third-party libraries.

**Symptoms**:
- Some UI components render with warnings
- Occasional hydration mismatches in development
- Certain animation libraries show deprecated warnings

**Affected Components**:
- `@radix-ui/react-*` components (warnings only)
- Motion/animation libraries (deprecation warnings)
- Some shadcn/ui components (minor visual issues)

**Current Workaround**:
```typescript
// Suppress hydration warnings in development
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  console.warn = (...args) => {
    if (args[0]?.includes?.('hydration')) return;
    console.warn(...args);
  };
}
```

**Planned Resolution**:
- **Option A**: Downgrade to React 18 + Next.js 14 LTS (Stable)
- **Option B**: Wait for library updates (2-3 months)
- **Timeline**: Decision by February 1, 2025

**Investigation Notes**:
- React 19 is very recent (December 2024)
- Many libraries haven't updated yet
- Performance benefits are minimal for our use case

### 2. Memory Usage During Development
**Status**: üîç Monitoring  
**Discovered**: January 8, 2025  
**Impact**: Development experience degradation

**Description**:
Development server occasionally exceeds 2GB RAM usage, causing system slowdown.

**Symptoms**:
- Slow build times after 2+ hours of development
- System memory warnings on machines with <16GB RAM
- Occasional development server crashes

**Triggers**:
- Long development sessions (>2 hours)
- Frequent hot reloading with large component changes
- Running multiple browser tabs with the application

**Current Workaround**:
```bash
# Restart development server every 2 hours
npm run clean && pnpm dev

# Monitor memory usage
top -pid $(pgrep -f "next-server")
```

**Planned Resolution**:
- Investigate webpack memory leak sources
- Implement automatic memory cleanup
- Add memory usage monitoring dashboard
- **Timeline**: February 15, 2025

**Monitoring Commands**:
```bash
# Check memory usage
ps aux | grep next-server
du -sh .next node_modules

# Clean restart protocol
npm run clean:cache && pnpm dev
```

### 3. Test Flakiness in Network-Dependent Tests
**Status**: üîß Partial Fix Applied  
**Discovered**: December 20, 2024  
**Impact**: CI/CD reliability, developer confidence

**Description**:
Some E2E tests fail intermittently due to network timing issues or external service dependencies.

**Affected Tests**:
- `tests/e2e/meetings-focused-test.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/ai-chat-chatgpt-style.spec.ts`
- `tests/e2e/asrs-form-comprehensive.spec.ts`

**Failure Patterns**:
- 10-15% failure rate in CI
- Usually pass on retry
- More frequent failures during high network latency

**Partial Fix Applied**:
```typescript
// Added retry logic and better waits
await page.waitForResponse(resp => resp.url().includes('/api/chat') && resp.status() === 200, {
  timeout: 10000
});

// Retry wrapper for flaky tests
test.describe.configure({ retries: 2 });
```

**Remaining Work**:
- Mock external API responses in tests
- Improve test data setup/teardown
- Add network condition simulation
- **Timeline**: January 30, 2025

## Medium Priority Issues üí°

*These issues cause minor inconveniences but don't block development*

### 4. Bundle Size Optimization Opportunities
**Status**: üìã Planned  
**Impact**: Load time, performance scores

**Description**:
Current bundle size is 1.2MB gzipped, could be optimized to <1MB.

**Analysis**:
- Large AI SDK dependencies
- Multiple UI component libraries
- Unused imports in some files

**Optimization Opportunities**:
```bash
# Largest dependencies
@radix-ui/* packages: 400KB
openai: 300KB
@supabase/* packages: 200KB
lucide-react: 150KB
```

**Planned Actions**:
1. Implement dynamic imports for AI components
2. Tree-shake unused UI components
3. Replace heavy dependencies with lighter alternatives
4. Implement bundle analysis automation

**Timeline**: March 1, 2025

---

### 5. TypeScript Strictness Improvements
**Status**: üìã Planned  
**Impact**: Code quality, maintainability

**Description**:
Some legacy code still uses `any` types and could benefit from stricter typing.

**Files Requiring Attention**:
```typescript
// Files with any usage (non-critical)
lib/db/actions-simple.ts: 3 instances
hooks/use-customers.tsx: 2 instances
components/dynamic-form.tsx: 4 instances
app/api/*/route.ts: Various files (5-8 instances)
```

**Improvement Plan**:
1. Create proper interfaces for complex objects
2. Add generic constraints where applicable
3. Migrate from `any` to `unknown` where type is truly unknown
4. Add utility types for common patterns

**Timeline**: February 28, 2025

---

### 6. API Route Documentation Gaps
**Status**: üìã Planned  
**Impact**: Developer experience, maintainability

**Description**:
Some API routes lack comprehensive documentation and OpenAPI schemas.

**Missing Documentation**:
- `/api/fm-global/*` routes
- `/api/insights/*` routes
- Error response formats
- Rate limiting information

**Planned Actions**:
1. Generate OpenAPI schema from existing routes
2. Add JSDoc comments to all API handlers
3. Create interactive API documentation
4. Document authentication requirements

**Timeline**: February 15, 2025

---

## Low Priority Issues üîß

*These issues are nice-to-have improvements but don't impact functionality*

### 7. Code Style Minor Inconsistencies
**Status**: üìã Backlog  
**Impact**: Developer experience

**Description**:
Minor inconsistencies in code formatting and comment styles.

**Examples**:
- Some files use `//` comments, others use `/* */`
- Inconsistent spacing in JSX props
- Mixed import styles (some use `import type`)

**Resolution Plan**:
- Update Prettier configuration
- Run automated formatting
- Add stricter ESLint rules

**Timeline**: When convenient (low priority)

---

### 8. Dependency Version Updates
**Status**: üìã Monitoring  
**Impact**: Security, performance

**Description**:
Several packages have newer versions available but aren't critical to update.

**Available Updates**:
```json
{
  "framer-motion": "12.23.12 ‚Üí 12.25.4",
  "lucide-react": "0.454.0 ‚Üí 0.460.0",
  "recharts": "2.15.4 ‚Üí 2.16.1",

}
```

**Update Strategy**:
- Minor/patch updates: Monthly
- Major updates: Quarterly, with testing
- Security updates: Immediate

**Timeline**: Monthly review cycle

---

### 9. Performance Micro-optimizations
**Status**: üìã Future Enhancement  
**Impact**: Marginal performance improvements

**Description**:
Small optimization opportunities for rarely-used features.

**Opportunities**:
- Lazy load admin panels
- Optimize rarely-used utility functions  
- Reduce re-renders in complex forms
- Cache expensive calculations

**Timeline**: When performance becomes a bottleneck

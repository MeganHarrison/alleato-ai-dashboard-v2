2.1.5 Final Extinguishment
Establish a pre-incident plan in cooperation with the local fire service and your local FM Global Engineering
Operations Center to address a means of achieving final extinguishment of a fire originating within the ASRSstorage array. See FM Global Property Loss Prevention Data Sheet (i.e., Data Sheet) 10-1, Pre-Incident
Planning, for general guidelines related to a pre-incident plan.
At a minimum, consider the following:
1. How access will be achieved to a fire anywhere within the storage array2. How will the storage array be disassembled, if required, and what equipment will be needed to get to
the seat of the fire
3. How many storage containers may be removed from the storage array to get to the seat of the fire
and where they will be placed during this process
4. What resources will be needed and how they can be implemented for restoration of the storage array
to minimize business interruption8-34 Protection for Automatic Storage

# PM RAG Worker Production Deployment Report

**Deployment Date**: September 4, 2025  
**Deployment Status**: ✅ Successfully Deployed  
**Production URL**: https://pm-rag-sep-1.megan-d14.workers.dev

## Deployment Summary

The PM RAG Worker has been successfully deployed to Cloudflare Workers production environment. The worker is live and operational, though there is a database function issue that needs to be addressed.

## Deployment Details

### Worker Configuration
- **Worker Name**: pm-rag-sep-1
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers with Node.js compatibility
- **Main Entry Point**: src/index.ts
- **Version ID**: 2369a07f-bb29-474d-ba34-f71c47684980
- **Worker Size**: 627.58 KiB (118.62 KiB gzipped)
- **Startup Time**: 15 ms

### Environment Setup
- **Cloudflare Account**: Megan@megankharrison.com
- **Account ID**: d1416265449d2a0bae41c45c791270ec
- **Wrangler Version**: 4.31.0

### Secrets Configuration
All required secrets are properly configured in Cloudflare:
- ✅ OPENAI_API_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_URL  
- ✅ SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- ✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- ✅ DATABASE_URL (additional)
- ✅ FIREFLIES_API_KEY (additional)

## Endpoint Verification

### 1. Health Check Endpoint ✅
```bash
GET https://pm-rag-sep-1.megan-d14.workers.dev/health
```
**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "PM RAG Agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-04T05:02:01.371Z"
}
```
**Status**: Working perfectly

### 2. Available Endpoints
The worker provides the following endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Health check (✅ Working)
- `POST /chat` - Chat with RAG capabilities 
- `POST /chat/stream` - Streaming chat responses
- `POST /search` - Semantic search through meeting chunks
- `POST /insights` - Generate insights from meeting transcripts

## Known Issues

### Database Function Issue
The worker is experiencing an issue with the Supabase RPC function `search_meeting_chunks_semantic`:

**Error**: `column m.meeting_date does not exist`

**Impact**: 
- The `/chat`, `/search`, and related endpoints that rely on semantic search are currently non-functional
- The health check endpoint works fine
- The worker itself is properly deployed and running

**Required Action**:
The Supabase database needs to have the correct RPC function created or updated. The function `search_meeting_chunks_semantic` is trying to access a column `meeting_date` that doesn't exist in the meetings table.

## Deployment Logs

```bash
# Worker deployment command
npx wrangler deploy

# Output

Current Version ID: 2369a07f-bb29-474d-ba34-f71c47684980
```

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Database Function**: Create or update the `search_meeting_chunks_semantic` RPC function in Supabase to match the expected schema
2. **Test All Endpoints**: Once the database function is fixed, verify all endpoints are working
3. **Monitor Performance**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the production worker
4. **Documentation**: Update API documentation with the production endpoint

## Worker Features

The deployed PM RAG Worker includes:
- Advanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities
- Meeting transcript processing and chunking
- Semantic search through meeting content
- Project context awareness
- Streaming chat responses for better UX
- CORS support for browser-based clients
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Security Considerations

- All API keys are properly secured as Cloudflare secrets
- CORS headers are configured to allow cross-origin requests
- Service role key is used for privileged database operations
- Error messages are sanitized to prevent information leakage

## Conclusion

The PM RAG Worker has been successfully deployed to production at the requested URL. While the deployment itself is complete and the worker is running, there is a database schema mismatch that needs to be resolved for full functionality. Once the Supabase RPC function is fixed, the worker will be fully operational.

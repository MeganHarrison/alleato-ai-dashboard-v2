# AI Project Manager with RAG Implementation Plan

## Overview

Transform the existing AI SDK 5 persistent chat into an expert Project Manager and Business Strategist that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide valuable insights from meeting data stored in the `meetings` and `meetings_chunks` tables.

## Current State
- ✅ AI SDK 5 persistent chat working with `chats`, `messages`, `parts` tables
- ✅ Database connection established with Supabase
- ✅ Meeting data available in `meetings` and `meetings_chunks` tables with embeddings
- ✅ Chat API endpoints functional

## Target Outcome

An intelligent Project Manager AI that:
- Analyzes meeting content and transcripts
- Provides strategic business insights
- Answers project-specific questions using RAG
- Maintains context through persistent chat history
- Offers actionable recommendations based on meeting data

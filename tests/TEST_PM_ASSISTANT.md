# Test PM Assistant - Manual Instructions

## Setup
1. Server is running on port: 3001
2. Test user has been created:
   - Email: test.user@testcompany.com
   - Password: TestPassword123!

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Login
1. Open browser to: http://localhost:3001/auth/login
2. Enter test credentials above
3. Click Login button
4. You should be redirected to the dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to PM Assistant
1. Click "PM Assistant" in the sidebar menu
2. The page should show:
   - Minimal header with "PM Assistant" title
   - Loading spinner initially
   - Then the chat interface

### Step 3: Check Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for:
   - "useChat result keys:" - should show available methods
   - "Available functions:" - should show which methods exist
   - Any error messages about handleSubmit

### Step 4: Test Chat
1. Try typing a message
2. Press Enter or click Send
3. Check if message is sent
4. Check console for any errors

## Expected Console Output
You should see something like:
```
useChat result keys: ['messages', 'isLoading', 'error', ...]
Available functions: { handleSubmit: true, ... }
```

## What We Fixed
1. Created EnhancedChatFixed component that handles different useChat API variations
2. Added proper error handling and debugging
3. The component now checks for handleSubmit, submit, or sendMessage functions

## Current Issues Being Debugged
1. The useChat hook might return different methods based on the AI SDK version
2. The PM Assistant is using a custom endpoint which might affect the API
3. Message persistence is handled server-side now

## If It Still Doesn't Work
1. Check the console for the exact useChat return values
2. Report which functions are available vs undefined
3. Check for any TypeScript errors in the console

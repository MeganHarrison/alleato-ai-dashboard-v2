# PM Assistant Auto-Initialization Test

## Expected Behavior (Better UX)

When a user navigates to `/pm-assistant`:

1. **Immediate Loading State** ✅
   - Shows loading spinner with "Initializing PM Assistant..."
   - No unnecessary button click required
   - Professional loading animation

2. **Automatic Chat Creation** ✅
   - Chat ID is created automatically on mount
   - No user action required
   - Seamless transition from loading to chat

3. **Error Handling** ✅
   - If initialization fails, shows clear error message
   - Provides "Refresh Page" button to retry
   - No confusing blank states

## Previous Poor UX ❌
- Required user to click "Start PM Assistant" button
- Added unnecessary friction
- Made the app feel less professional
- Confused users about why manual start was needed

## Code Changes
- Added `useEffect` to auto-initialize on mount
- Changed initial `isInitializing` state to `true`
- Added proper error state handling
- Removed the entire welcome screen with button

## Benefits
- Zero-click experience
- Faster time to value
- More professional feel
- Consistent with modern app expectations
- Better matches other chat interfaces (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to `/pm-assistant`
2. Should see loading spinner immediately
3. Chat interface should appear automatically
4. No button clicks required

# PM Assistant Auto-Initialization Test Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Manual UI Test (`test-pm-ui.html`)
- Updated Test 2: Now checks for "Initializing PM Assistant..." loading state instead of button
- Updated Test 3: Verifies UI elements appear after auto-loading (no button click required)
- Removed references to "Start PM Assistant" button

### 2. Playwright E2E Tests (`pm-assistant.spec.ts`)
- Updated main test to verify auto-initialization behavior
- Added test for graceful error handling during initialization
- Removed all instances of clicking "Start PM Assistant" button
- Increased timeout from 10s to 15s to account for initialization time
- Updated test names to reflect new behavior

### 3. Test Flow Changes

#### Old Flow:
1. Page loads → Shows welcome screen with button
2. User clicks "Start PM Assistant"
3. Chat initializes
4. Chat interface appears

#### New Flow:
1. Page loads → Shows "Initializing PM Assistant..." immediately
2. Auto-initialization happens in background
3. Loading disappears
4. Chat interface appears automatically

## Running Tests
